 - We expect over 90k Pewlett Hackard to retire in the next year
 - Approximately 2/3 of these potential retirees are split between Senior Engineers and Senior Staff  

## Summary: 

Pewlett Hackard will need to start hiring and mentoring programs as soon as possible. This upcoming "silver tsunami" could leave our organization with a leadership and domain knowledge vacuum. Next steps:

 - Group mentorship program candidates by title to understand gaps based on role
 - Share data with leadership and talent acquisition teams as soon as possible, limiting risk
